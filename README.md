# Annotation Guideline
## Definition of positive and negative reviews: 
Positive review: Text expresses positive sentiment towards the product. For example, happy, satisfied, good, etc.

Negative review: Text expresses negative sentiment towards the product. For example, disappointed, bad, poor, etc.

## Beware of sarcasms: 
Some reviews may first look to be positive but are actually negative. 

For example, "I love waiting for hours for my food to arrive" is a negative review.

## Examples 
Positive review: "Absolutely love The Big Bang Theory DVD! Every episode is a burst of laughter and joy."

Negative review: "Disappointed with the DVD quality of The Big Bang Theory. Episodes skip and the audio is off."

Negative review (sarcastic): "The Big Bang Theory DVD is perfect for insomniacs. Its humor puts you to sleep faster than a lullaby!"

# Usage

2. Run the only code block in the `annotation.py` file, that's it!

# Heads up
The output is in another file: `data/7_annotated_{user_sciper}.jsonl`, so please make sure your input SCIPER is correct ;-)
