{"review": "Peter Drucker, an editorial columnist for the Wall Street Journal, a consultant and writer has been duly noted as one of the world's most respected management thinkers. His books, over 20 of them, have been called the \"landmarks of the managerial profession\" by the Harvard Business Review.  He has always been a step ahead of the curve of the latest in business thought.  In 1954 he espoused the idea of 'teams.'  In 1969 he proposed the 'knowledge workers' concept. Here Drucker lays out six of the 'new' challenges facing the businesses of the early 21st century. First involves management's new paradigm of organizational structure and managing people.  There is no 'one size fits all' approach.  The method or combinations of methods that may be required are ultimately determined by what the customer considers is 'value.'  Employees of the future may be treated as partners and volunteers, 'persuaded' rather than 'ordered.' The next challenge is the new certainties of the coming business landscape.  The collapsing birthrate and the shift in the distribution of income need to be studied and planned for.  Global competitiveness is a must for survival.  Performance needs to be redefined for the organization on more than just short-term gains in order to inspire and commit 'knowledge workers' to their mission. Third is becoming a change leader.  Educate others that change equals opportunity.  Regularly abandon activities that no longer produce results.  Enhance practices that have been working by exploiting and publishing their success throughout the company.  Study what is working or not in the market with other companies. Don't confuse motion with action. Fourth are the information challenges.  The purpose of information is not knowledge but being able to take the right action.  Success is based on the creation of value and wealth in the eyes of the customer.  Information needed would include the normal foundation information as well as productivity, competence and allocation of scarce resources information. The fifth challenge lies in vitalizing 'knowledge workers' into high productivity.  Attention should be given to all ways to make this asset grow.  Differing from manual laborers, knowledge workers carry the 'means of production' within them and rely less on a specific employer for work. The sixth challenge is managiing ourself (ourselves).  The biggest possible increase in production lies here.  Intellectual arrogance promotes disabling ignorance.  Concentrate on your strengths.  Avoid trying to change yourself.  Ask yourself what your strengths are.  Determine how you work.  Do you like to work alone?  Would you prefer to be an advisor or a decision maker?  What are your values?  This type of questioning will help determine where you belong.  Most of our careers will involve changing organizations at least once.  You must learn what makes 'you' tick.

{"review": "This book is first published in 1999.  Right in the beginning, Drucker defined management as NOT only business management, but management in all kinds of organization: government, university, hospital, army, non-profit organization, etc.  The book is easy to read, just below 200 pages.  The scope and content is much wider than how we think management usually is.  It describes the CERTAINTIES: collapsing birthrate, shift in performance, global competitiveness, etc, and of course, how it affects all kinds of organizations.  It talks about information challenges, the knowledge worker and how one manage oneself in this new century.  Concepts like \"individuals will outlive their organization\", \"how to defines one's goal and contribution\" are all interesting topics and issues that everyone have to face, since, this is the REALITIES.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, not just CEO/executives, but those want to know more about oneself, how to behave and contribute in this KNOWLEDGE BASE WORLD", "domain": "books", "label": ""}
{"review": "Regrettably, Peter Drucker passed away just a few days after I picked up this 1999 release. At the age of 89 (in 1999), Drucker proved himself more than capable of comprehending the changes information technology would force on business. His chapter on \"Information Challenges,\" at 38 pages one of the longest in the book, Drucker correctly states that irnformation technology was shifting focus from data to the meaning of data. Few companies exemplify this better than Wal-Mart with their highly developed systems of measuring consumer behavior and translating the information into action all through their supply chain. Perhaps earlier and more consistently than any other management writer, Drucker recognized that \"more and more people in the workforce - and most knowledge works - will have to MANAGE THEMSELVES.\" (Emphasis in original.) Drucker recognized that many people had to plan second careers for the second half of their lives, something he himself did. As Drucker put it in his introduction, the advice in this book requires a reversal of what most people have thought about management for more than a century. With this book, as with all of his others, Drucker may be gone physicially, but his thoughts will live on for many decades to come. Jerr", "domain": "books", "label": ""}

{"review": "An experienced Author's presentation 'Management Challenges for the 21st Century' is a challenging and an inspiring Read. Since years, there has been drastic changes in social and economic levels. Management requires re-shaping the business strategies from time to time. Peter offers new paradigms of management with thoughtful implementations of strategic ideas to face the critical areas, weaker spots, problems, practises and how to face in the 21st century. Slightly for the genius minds, the book demands deep business sense and profound knowledge. Management needs to indepth recognising strengths and analysing on performance, clear goals on how to achieve quality work, motivation and getting quipped with innovation. Peter argues that management will increase the productivity of the knowledge worker and with the global competitiveness, he focus on re-definition of corporate performance. Peter offer lessons with the major chapters like 'Management's New Paradigms, Strategy, The New Certainties, The Change Leader, Information Challenges, Knowledge-Worker Productivity, and Managing Oneself for the new waves. In the chapter 'The Change Leader', he clearly motivates the leaders to be ahead of times by starving the problems and feeding opportunities. The uncertainties can be overcome with change in accepting new and abandoning old patterns of management and make an increase in productivity. The Knowledge worker chapter is to enhance productivity piloting to fresh new innovative ideas. Managing oneself is a thorough learning guide as Peter leaves no room in grooming the new age management leader.

I would rate this book highly, along with one of my favorite grief authors, thanatologist Alan Wolfelt (e.g. Understanding Your Grief books).  Harper Neeld seamlessly combines her painful, personal story with factual, helpful guidelines to create one of the best written boooks I have read on widowhood.

Elixabeth put the most important step first \"To experience and express grief fully.\"  There are hundreds of ways to run away from grief, but it is necessary \"to feel it to heal it.\" I was given the best advice by a friend who said to \"lean into the pain.\" The second choice \"To endure with patience,\" has helped me be more patient and compassionate with myself.

I've never taken a business class, and my career is completely unrelated, but I needed something to help me plan my finances.

{"review": "Since \"ER\" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's taken the nation by storm.  It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton,  a former surgeon before his writing career.  For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television.  The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton).  It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys.  Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode.  Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes. Season one introduces the everyday life in the ER in Chicago.  Throughout, it explores many critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others.  Regular show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997), Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many others.  Such combination shows partially how the show's theme evolved to today.  Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on top.  The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience. Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official cast member until season 3).  This season explores Ross's most heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being forced to care for her neice, and many more.  Today's viewers who haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism, Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle), and others.  This plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season.  It continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama. Both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast.  All add their own sense of individual theme into every scene.  Through personal struggles, drama, and continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor. Such show quality makes \"ER - The Complete First Two Seasons\" worthy for all fans.  This is sure to please its audiences.  New viewers should watch these two seasons first.  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing.  Fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future", "domain": "dvd", "label": ""}
{"review": "The Crow (Collector's Series Boxed Set) consists of the first three of four in the series. Although all three have the same theme, each is quite different and exciting", "domain": "dvd", "label": ""}
{"review": "The trio of The Crow films (yes, I enjoyed The Crow City Of Angels much as I enjoyed the first and the third) are unique by their own right, using brilliant cinematography to edge out the difference between them: The first, black and white homage to the graphic novels, with little pints of color; The second, sickly-greenish colors but somewhat interesting, as it shows us an ill-ridden type of a city much needing an angel guarding it; and the lively-yet-dark third movie, to show us real life tale of cruel justice gone bad. In each tale, The Crow is adapted quickly to his poor circumstances and finds his strength in the one true link to his former love (In the second, its the one true pure soul left in the city, Sarah), and badder-than-ever villains. Brandon Lee's performance will become (if not already) legendary, and I refer to his DVD interview to emphasis its greatness (\"because we do not know when we will die, we think of life as an inexhaustable well\" will suffice with all the irony that goes along with it). These three are classics, not to be confused with the fourth, which has less impact, since it tries too hard to be original, yet looses something along the way in terms of casting, acting, and cinematography, as the desert-themed atmosphere hasn't worked that well. Should have used more of that \"grittier\" feel to the scenes (like the four horsemen's introduction scenes), if you ask me. Having read Poppy Z. Brite's \"The Crow: The Lazarus Heart\", I found it more suitable for an on-screen adaptation, and thinking of it as taking The Crow in more nastier ways than ever before.

{"review": "The second and third films are basically garbage. If THE CROW, directed by Proyas is the standard, then the rest are so far separated, that they fall into Oblivion. The tale as played by Brandon Lee works on just so many levels, and is in my view , one of the best films about Justice for victims. I have a number of versions of the CROW on VHS and DVD, and the Extras on the triple pack fail in one respect; there is an interview with Lee on the VHS version that is without a doubt, one of the most poignant, touching, and eerily prescient interviews on tape. Lee talks about how we think it is all so limitless, and yet... how many times will we see the Moonrise, how many times will the things we love happen, in other words, the moments we have are precious... it is not that he was preaching some sort of live for the now moment, but that he wanted is to think about what it is that we have now , because if we do not realise what we have in the current moment, we may very well lose something extremely pure and vibrant. And just the loss ,the loss , or at least the change, of this one interview is enough to make an impact on the overall feel of the DVD. However, the triple  pack is well worth it, if only to get the brilliant film, and to confirm that nothing holds a candle to the original THE CROW, and the sequels should never have been made... Lee's legacy should have been left as it was. Lee is truly masterful in this film. Milking the franchise destroys Brandons Legacy", "domain": "dvd", "label": ""}

It contains all three of the \"collectors series\" versions, which means that they are packed full of special features.

I really can't quite get the resentment of some people over the last two films. I mean, the original comics were about the reoccuring theme of different Crows and different injustices to be righted.

The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways?

{"review": "I baught my 8\" global chef's knife about 5 years ago.  It has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market.  The molybdenum/vanadium steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its Henkles/Wustolf counterparts.  My only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style, nor my large hands.  I don't mind the steel handles, although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip.  My main problem is with the tapered bolster, which is almost a lack of bolster altogether.  Coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife, extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand. I highly recommend globals, but I might suggest the 8 1/4\" heavyweight model, which appears to have a more standard handle design and less tapering to the Bolster.

{"review": "The design for using the DC adapter with this little light is extremely poor.  It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter.  But, it must not have been very big.  I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case.  These were brand new batteries.  There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them.  This is bad.  Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries. Then, after I cleaned it all up, it worked for about a week w/o the batteries installed.  Then the LEDs started flickering.  The next day, it was dead.  To see if it had to do with the battery leak, I took the little guy apart and found that the power was still getting all of the way up into the head.  But something on the little circuit board must have blown. The other part of the design that is bad is that the metal clip has a sharp edge that digs into and tears up the pages of the book.  I found this a problem with soft cover books, at least.  Putting a little electrical tape of the end made it better. I had hoped that the design of this edition would last longer than previous editions.  I've gone through many Zelco lights and stretched out their lifespan by repairing the poor connections as they wear out.  This one is beyond my ability and I'm done giving Zelco my money.  They are a nice idea, but have no durability.

My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures.  Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked.  I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe.  The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon.

I also really like the horizontal full loaf pan.  You can make normal sandwich loaves with this design. The one thing that could be improved would be to add more user control to allow a baker to set all the resting, rising and baking times individually.

If not, I tweak the recipe, I don't blame the machine. All in all, an excellent product. This is my favorite bread machine so far.  The only down side is the sourdough setting.  Don't be fooled... the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar.  For true sourdough, you have to wait the 7-10 days.  But if you can't wait....  Oh, and the \"big viewing window\".

{"review": "Within a few weeks of purchase the teflon in the Zojirushi pan started to blister and flake off. This is NOT the result of customer abuse but a manufacturing defect. This is my third (and final) bread machine. The first two were Breadman Ultimates. I should note that I make bread in the machine about 6 times a week on average, pretty much every morning. The first Breadman worked for over a year until the teflon in the pan started to fail. This was probably my fault for allowing the pan to soak for extended periods of time (water can get behind the teflon and ruin the bond). I bought an new Breadman Ultimate because the entire machine was only slightly more than the pan alone and the old machine was starting to have mechanical problems. This time I took extremely good care of the pan (letting it cool down, no soaking) because it's clearly the weak link in the system. Within 8 months the stirring shaft that drives the paddle in the pan simply fell out. Whatever the detente mechanism was that holds the shaft to the pan failed, making the machine useless. Currently it doesn't seem very easy (or even possible) to buy a replacement pan for the Breadman. At this point I was done with the Breadman. Much as I didn't want to spring for the extra money for the Zojirushi, and realizing that my default augmented sourdough recipe probably wouldn't work the same in the new machine, I didn't see an alternative and got one. Within 3 weeks the teflon in the Zoji pan formed two blisters. One is bit smaller than a dime and all the teflon at this spot has flaked off; the other spot is blistering but the teflon is still intact. I have been extremely careful with the pan: I wait for it to cool and then remove the baked-on bread under the paddles with warm water using mostly my fingers. I don't let it soak at all. This is clearly a manufacturing defect. I have further complaints with respect to this machine as compared to the Breadman Ultimate: 1) The top of the bread rarely gets brown. I've added more sugar to the recipe which helps slightly but not much. 2) I don't understand what the crust control option does. It doesn't seem to increase baking time which it does on the Breadman so it doesn't make much sense. 3) The programmability is very weak. On the Breadman you can take any of the existing standard options and modify them as well as make up entirely new programs. 4) The programmability options are very limited: - You can't control the knockdown time between risings. - You can't add risings to the default three. They do give you a lot of time control on the risings. - You can't separate the mixing cycle from the kneading cycle: it's all one cycle. - When you turn off the preheat cycle, this only affects the built-in programs and not the custom ones. - And worst of all: you can't bake for more than 70 minutes. This is utterly ridiculous. I'm sure this is a \"safety feature\" but it means you can't correct for the pathetic lack of crust formation or have larger recipes and so forth. This is almost a killer limitation in my opinion. For those other reviewers that are having issues with rising, I've determined that the machine is very sensitive to the amount, type, and quality of yeast. If you *exactly* follow the manufacturers instuctions with respect to yeast and use fresh yeast, it should work okay. This means you must use rapid rise yeast with the Quick programs and active dry yeast with the longer standard programs. Even using Fleischmann's instead of Red Star made a difference. The Breadman was pretty much indifferent to yeast variations. At this point I'm done with bread machines. They are a failed technology. In fact, teflon is a dangerous and substandard technology. All you have to do is search for teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and toxic to come up with some pretty alarming data on this noxious substance. The manufacturing process results in significant environmental contamination. A direct consumer health risk due to toxic outgassing occurs when teflon is exposed to temperatures above 500 degrees (eg: frying pans). Perhaps bread machines are not that risky given the lower temps involved in baking and the fact that wet dough will keep the average pan temperature pretty low, but if you know anything about toxicity you will realize that it is always a sliding scale: there will be some outgassing at lower temperatures. Imagine low levels of toxic gas released into your homemade bread. I've thought about this, but there's no way to make a bread machine without teflon -- going from mixing dough to baking requires teflon, there is just no other viable solution. I love making bread every day and I'm going to miss this activity but at this point the manufacturing defects and use of teflon mean I have to give up on this technology. It's back to the occasional hand-made loaf -- it's the only rational and healthy solution", "domain": "housewares", "label": ""}
